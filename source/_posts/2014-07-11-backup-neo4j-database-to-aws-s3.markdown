### Update (2014-07-28)

I got some issues using `tar` with big folder size. I fixed it by using
using [7zip](http://www.7-zip.org/download.html) using [LZMA2](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lempel%E2%80%93Ziv%E2%80%93Markov_chain_algorithm) compression algorithm instead [LZO][3].

New **Gist** available [here](https://gist.github.com/kwent/82f544dd0488619fd596). Please feel free to improve it !

## Purpose

I needed to daily backup a [Neo4j Database][6] on [AWS S3][5] via a cron task so i
developed a shell script doing the job.

## Script

### Steps

1. `neo4j-backup` is doing a backup of the database to a local target folder
given. Be sure to have the available space in local.
**Binary** :  [neo4j-backup][1]

2. `tar` is archiving all files into one. No gzip or bzip compression here
since it was too slow for my file (> 100 Go).
**Binary** : [tar][7]

3. `lzop` is a very fast compression algorithm who compressing the file in few
minutes and is saving file size to upload on [AWS S3][5]. 
**Binary** : [lzop][3]

4. `aws s3 cp` is uploading our file to S3 using [Amazon S3 Multipart Upload][4] if
the file size is big. It's uploading a file faster.
**Binary** : [aws][2]

## Cron task

Add a file into `/etc/cron.d/neo4j-backup` with:

```bash
# Run a daily backup at 4:00 AM.
0 4 * * * root /bin/sh /opt/neo4j-enterprise-1.9.8/backup_neo4j_to_s3.sh 127.0.0.1 6362 /mnt/datadisk/backup
```

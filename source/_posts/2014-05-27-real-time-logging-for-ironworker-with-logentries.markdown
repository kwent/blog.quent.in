## Purpose

When you a executing a job with [Iron Worker Service][1] and writing logs on `STDOUT` you have
to wait that the job is terminated to read the log file. Not very convenient if
want to see your logs in real time right ?

Iron blog wrote a post about [how setup real time logging with papertrail][4].

This post is how setup real time logging with [logentries][2].

## Logentries

### Add a new logtype and select manual configuration

### Select Plain UDP/TCP log type

### Copy/Paste the UDP or TCP port logentries just created for you

It's time now to relaunch a job and see your logs in real time.

title: How to patch CVE-2014-0160 in OpenSSL
---

**OpenSSL** has a **critical security vulnerability** that needs to be patched right away.

This bug in OpenSSL has been found affecting versions **1.0.1 through 1.0.1f (inclusive) and 1.0.2-beta**.

Upgrading OpenSSL version to **1.0.1g** is fixing this security vulnerability.

### Below the **single command line** to compiling and install the **last openssl version**.

```
curl https://www.openssl.org/source/openssl-1.0.1g.tar.gz | tar xz && cd openssl-1.0.1g && sudo ./config && sudo make && sudo make install
```

### Replace old openssl binary file by the new one via a symlink.

```sh
sudo ln -sf /usr/local/ssl/bin/openssl `which openssl`
```

### You are all good !

```sh
# openssl version should return
openssl version
OpenSSL 1.0.1g 7 Apr 2014
```

## Notes

This is not fixing **Nginx** and **Apache** server who have to be recompile with **1.0.1g** openSSL sources.

**Introduction**

I postulate to a job few months ago via a Korben retweet [https://remixjobs.com/emploi/Developpement/URGENT-Developpeur-iOS-et-ou-Ruby-Fun-social-gaming-H-F/12950](https://remixjobs.com/emploi/Developpement/URGENT-Developpeur-iOS-et-ou-Ruby-Fun-social-gaming-H-F/12950)

The job was very attractive and the concept amazing. It's talking about turn your life into an adventure by uploading pictures to complete some missions.

### And now ?

After a 6 months accelelaror program in Paris ([Le Camping](https://www.lecamping.org/)) and 3 months in San Francisco ([I/O Ventures](https://www.ventures.io/)), they're back in Paris.

I joined the team as **« Software Development Guy »** since this week and we're preparing some new features for you ! Be patient!

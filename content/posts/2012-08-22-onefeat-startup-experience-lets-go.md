**Introduction**

<p>
  I postulate to a job few months ago via a Korben retweet <a href="https://remixjobs.com/emploi/Developpement/URGENT-Developpeur-iOS-et-ou-Ruby-Fun-social-gaming-H-F/12950" target="_blank">https://remixjobs.com/emploi/Developpement/URGENT-Developpeur-iOS-et-ou-Ruby-Fun-social-gaming-H-F/12950</a>
</p>

<p>
  The job was very attractive and the concept amazing. It's talking about turn your life into an adventure by uploading pictures to complete some missions.
</p>

<h3>
  And now ?
</h3>

<p>
  After a 6 months accelelaror program in Paris (<a href="https://www.lecamping.org/" target="_blank">Le Camping</a>) and 3 months in San Francisco (<a href="https://www.ventures.io/" target="_blank">I/O Ventures</a>), they're back in Paris.
</p>
